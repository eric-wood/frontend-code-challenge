## Notes About Dark Sky
Dark Sky is a weather API service. Documentation can be found [here](https://darksky.net/dev/docs#forecast-request). An API key will be provided at the beginning of the code test.

Unfortunately, the service only accepts latitude/longitude as request params so to help you get started here are some easy mappings:
```
Denver        - 39.7392,-104.9903
New York City - 40.7128,-74.0060
Los Angelos   - 34.0522,-118.2437
```
