## Notes About Dark Sky
Dark Sky is a weather API service. An API key will be provided at the beginning of the code test. Unfortunately, the service only accepts latitude/longitude as request params so to help you get started here are some easy mappings:
```
Denver        - 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W
New York City - 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W
Los Angelos   - 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W
```
